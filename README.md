# Call-Center-Analysis-PowerBi-Dashboard

I have done this project as part of PwC's virtual case experience program through Forage's platform. The first task to be completed was creating a Power BI dashboard for a telecom client.


üìç The telecom client was seeking a solution to gain better visibility and understanding of their call centre operations. Using Power BI, I created a comprehensive dashboard that provided real-time data on call volumes, Avg speed of Answer, Avg Talk duration, Calls Answered Vs Calls Resolved and CSAT .

 üìç By visualizing this information, the client could easily analyze agent productivity, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their call centre operations. This transparency and understanding empowered the client to improve customer service and overall efficiency.
